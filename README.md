During my time at northcoders bootcamp, I was challenged with creating a full stack reddit style web application. 

The first week focused on building the back-end api which I built from scratch using git version control and TDD.
The backend git hub repo can be found here: https://github.com/Raedaw/backend-project
The api is hosted at: https://rachels-nc-notes.herokuapp.com/api

This repo is from the second week of my project which focused on creating the front end application using React.

The complete project can be viewed at:
